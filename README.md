# Color Servo Control
# ----------------------
#
# Rotate a 180 degree Servo motor connected to digital pin 10 to the middle
# when red color sensed, clockwise when blue sense & counterclockwise when 
# green is sensed.
# 
# In my setup, this requires 4 AA batteries to power the Servo & USB connection 
# to power the Arduino Uno board.
